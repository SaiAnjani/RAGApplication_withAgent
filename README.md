A Streamlit-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application that allows users to upload invoices and ask questions about them. The system uses Nomic embeddings directly from Hugging Face and FAISS for efficient document retrieval and question answering.

## Features

- Upload multiple PDF invoices
- Process and index invoice content
- Persistent storage of processed documents
- Separate processing and querying modes
- Ask questions about the invoices
- Get relevant answers based on the invoice content
- Fast and efficient local processing
